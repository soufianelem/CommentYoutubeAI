## Troubleshooting

### Button Not Appearing
1. **Check Console**: Open DevTools (F12) and look for errors

3. **Wait Longer**: Some pages take time to load completely
4. **Try Different Video**: Some videos have comments disabled

### Analysis Fails
1. **Scroll Down**: Ensure comments section is visible
2. **Wait for Comments**: Let comments fully load before clicking
3. **Try Smaller Video**: Start with videos that have fewer comments
4. **Check Network**: Ensure stable internet connection

### Console Debugging
Open DevTools (F12) and check these commands:
```javascript
// Check if extension is loaded
window.SentimentAnalyzer_Debug?.isInitialized()

// Force reinitialization
window.SentimentAnalyzer_Debug?.cleanup()
window.SentimentAnalyzer_Debug?.initialize()

// Check current page type
window.YouTubeDetector?.isVideoPage()
```
